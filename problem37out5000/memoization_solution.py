        Efficiently computes the nth Fibonacci number using recursion with memoization.

        üìå Why Memoization?
        Without memoization, the recursive approach recalculates the same values multiple times,
        resulting in exponential time complexity (O(2^n)). By storing already computed results
        in a hash table, we reduce the time complexity to O(n).

        ‚ûï Advantages:
        - Reduces time complexity from exponential to linear
        - Avoids redundant calculations
        - Demonstrates dynamic programming principles

        :param ht: Dictionary to store previously computed results

        # Base Case: Return cached value if exists

            return ht[n]

        # Recursive Case with Memoization
        ht[n] = self.fib(n - 1, ht) + self.fib(n - 2, ht)
        return ht[n]
