        Computes the nth Fibonacci number using a space-optimized iterative approach.

        ðŸ“Œ Why This Method?
        ----------------------------------------
        - Time Complexity: O(n)
        - Space Complexity: O(1) âœ…
        - Unlike the recursive or tabulated approaches, this solution uses only two variables
          to keep track of the last two Fibonacci numbers, making it highly efficient and
          memory-friendly.

        âž• Ideal for scenarios where:
        - You're working with limited memory.
        - You need maximum performance for large `n`.
        - You want to demonstrate mastery of dynamic programming simplification.
