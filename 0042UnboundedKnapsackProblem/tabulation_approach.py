def knapsack_max_value(num_items, max_weight, values, weights) -> int:
    """
    Solves the unbounded knapsack problem using tabulation (bottom-up dynamic programming).

    Args:
        num_items (int): Number of items available.
        max_weight (int): Maximum weight capacity of the knapsack.
        values (list): List of values for each item.
        weights (list): List of weights for each item.

    Returns:
        int: Maximum value obtainable with the given constraints.

    Time Complexity:
        O(N * W), where N is the number of items and W is the maximum weight capacity.
        For each capacity, we iterate through all items.

    Space Complexity:
        O(W), since we use a 1D array (dp_table) to store results for capacities up to `max_weight`.
