    "## The Description for the Poblem 'Unbounded Knapsack Problem'\n",
    "The **Unbounded Knapsack Problem** is a classic optimization problem in computer science. It's a variation of the famous 0/1 Knapsack Problem.\n",
    "Imagine you have a knapsack with a specific **weight capacity** and a list of different types of items. Each item type has a weight and a value. Unlike *the 0/1 knapsack*, where you can only choose each item once, in the **Unbounded Knapsack problem**, you can take an unlimited number of items of each type.\n",
    "The goal is to determine the combination of items that will fit into the knapsack and yield **the maximum possible total value**.\n",
    "This problem is a great example to demonstrate different algorithmic approaches, from a simple but inefficient recursive solution to more optimized techniques like **dynamic programming**."

    "### First Approaches (The Recursive Approach ðŸ§ )\n",
    "The recursive approach is **a straightforward and intuitive way** to solve the Unbounded Knapsack Problem. It's based on a *\"divide and conquer\" strategy*, where we break down a large problem into smaller, identical subproblems until we reach a simple base case.\n",
    "In this method, we define a function that calculates the maximum value for a given knapsack capacity. To do this, the function considers each item one by one. For each item, it has a choice: either take the item or don't. Since we can take an item multiple times, if we decide to take an item, we add its value and then recursively call the same function for the remaining capacity, allowing us to take that same item again.\n",
    "The process continues until the remaining capacity **is zero or less**, which __is our base case__. At that point, the function stops and returns a value. By exploring all these choices and returning the maximum value from all possible paths, the recursion naturally finds the optimal solution.\n",
    "_While this approach is easy to understand_, it's computationally expensive because it re-solves the same subproblems repeatedly, leading to an exponential time complexity. This is why we will later explore more efficient solutions."

This is because for each unit of remaining capacity, the function might try to include any of the n items, leading to a branching factor of n. The recursive calls form a tree where many subproblems are computed repeatedly. For example, **calculate_max_value(3)** might be called from both calculate_max_value(5) (by taking an item of weight 2) and calculate_max_value(4) (by taking an item of weight 1), leading to redundant calculations.\n",

In the worst-case scenario, where we continuously select the item with the smallest weight (e.g., a weight of 1), the recursion would go from max_weight down to 0. Each call adds a new stack frame. Therefore, the space complexity is linear with respect to the maximum weight, represented as **O(W)**."

    "The memoization approach is a powerful optimization technique that solves the Unbounded Knapsack problem by combining recursion with a cache to avoid redundant calculations. This method is often called \"top-down\" because it starts with the largest problem (the full knapsack capacity) and breaks it down into smaller subproblems.\n",
