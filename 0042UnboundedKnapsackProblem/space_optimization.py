def knapsack_max_value(num_items, max_weight, values, weights) -> int:
    """
    Solves the unbounded knapsack problem using a space-optimized tabulation approach.

    Args:
        num_items (int): Number of items available.
        max_weight (int): Maximum weight capacity of the knapsack.
        values (list): List of values for each item.
        weights (list): List of weights for each item.

    Returns:
        int: Maximum value obtainable with the given constraints.

    Time Complexity:
        O(N * W), where N is the number of items and W is the maximum weight capacity.
        For each item, we iterate through all capacities.

    Space Complexity:
        O(W), since we use a 1D array to store results for capacities up to `max_weight`.

    Explanation:
        - This approach builds the solution incrementally by considering each item and weight capacity.
        - The "space-optimization" lies in using a single 1D array (dp_table) instead of a 2D table.
