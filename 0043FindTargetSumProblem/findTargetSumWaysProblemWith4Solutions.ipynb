    "## First Approach: Backtracking (Recursion)\n",
    "This initial approach leverages recursion to explore all possible __combinations of plus and minus signs__. While this method isn't the most efficient for larger inputs, it provides a great foundation for understanding the problem's structure. It's a classic example of a backtracking algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The core idea is** to build the expression step-by-step. _Starting with the first number_, we have two choices: **either add it or subtract it**. We then recursively explore these two paths for the next number in the array. This process continues until we have processed every number. When we reach the end of the array, we check if the current sum matches the target. If it does, we've found one valid combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "_By systematically exploring every possible path_, we're guaranteed to find all valid expressions. This exhaustive search ensures correctness but can be computationally expensive, as the number of paths doubles with each element in the array. \n",

    "## Second Approach: memorization approach\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "<b>Memoization</b> is an optimization technique used primarily with recursive algorithms. It's not a new algorithm itself, but a way to speed up existing ones. The core idea is to store the results of expensive function calls and return the cached result when the same inputs occur again.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b><i>For the Target Sum problem</i></b>:the recursive backtracking solution re-computes the same subproblems repeatedly. For example, if you're at nums[i] with a current_sum, you might reach that exact state (i, current_sum) from multiple different paths. Without memoization, you'd re-calculate the number of ways from that point for every single path.\n",
    "\n",
    "With memoization, you use a data structure (like a dictionary or a 2D array) to act as a cache. <b><i>Before making a recursive call </i></b> for a state (index, current_sum), you first check if the result for that state is already in your cache. If it is, you simply return the stored value. If not, you compute the result, store it in the cache, and then return it. This drastically reduces the number of redundant calculations, turning an exponential time complexity into a polynomial one.\n",

    "## Space Optimization (Tabulation)\n",
    "`**Space optimization**` is a technique used in dynamic programming to significantly reduce memory usage. It's based on the observation that when building a solution, you often only need the results from the immediately preceding step to compute the current one. You don't need to store the entire history of intermediate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the ` **Target Sum problem** `, our tabulation approach built a dp_table for each number in the input array. With space optimization, we realize that to calculate the possible sums for nums[i], we only need the sums from the table of nums[i-1]. We can discard all earlier tables.\n",

    "    <li>Creating a single  to hold the counts for the current iteration.</li>\n",
