    "# Complexity Analysis: Edit Distance Problem (Memoization Approach)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Description\n",
    "The Edit Distance problem involves finding the minimum number of operations required to convert one string (`word1`) into another string (`word2`). The allowed operations are:\n",
    "1. **Insert** a character.\n",
    "2. **Delete** a character.\n",
    "3. **Replace** a character.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Complexity Analysis (Memoization Approach)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity: **O(m * n)**\n",
    "- **Explanation**:\n",
    "  - The memoized recursive approach uses a 2D table (`memo_table`) to store results for each pair of indices `(index1, index2)` corresponding to substrings of `word1` and `word2`.\n",
    "  - Each unique state `(index1, index2)` is computed only once.\n",
    "  - The total number of states is proportional to the product of the lengths of the two strings, i.e., `m * n`, where:\n",
    "    - `m` is the length of `word1`.\n",
    "    - `n` is the length of `word2`.\n",
    "  - Each state computation involves constant-time operations (comparison and minimum calculation).\n",
    "  - Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(m * n)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity:\n",
    "#### **O(m * n)** (Standard Memoization)\n",
    "- **Explanation**:\n",
    "  - A 2D memoization table (`memo_table`) of size `m * n` is used to store the results of all unique states `(index1, index2)`.\n",
    "  - This ensures that previously computed states can be reused, eliminating redundant calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **O(m + n)** (With Space Optimization):\n",
    "- **Explanation**:\n",
    "  - Space optimization can be applied by reducing the memoization table to a single row or column.\n",
    "  - Instead of storing results for all previous states, we only keep track of the current and previous rows/columns.\n",
    "  - This reduces the space complexity to **O(min(m, n))** while maintaining the time complexity of **O(m * n)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Insights\n",
    "1. **Efficiency**:\n",
    "   - The memoized approach significantly improves performance compared to the naive recursive solution, which has exponential complexity (**O(3^(m+n))**).\n",
    "   - By avoiding redundant computations, the memoized approach ensures a polynomial time complexity of **O(m * n)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Memory Usage**:\n",
    "   - The standard memoization approach uses **O(m * n)** space due to the 2D table.\n",
    "   - Space optimization techniques can reduce this to **O(min(m, n))**, making it suitable for scenarios with memory constraints.\n",

    "  - The algorithm iterates over all characters of `word1` (n iterations) and `word2` (m iterations).\n",

    "  - Instead of storing an entire 2D DP table of size `(n + 1) x (m + 1)`, this approach uses only two 1D arrays (`prev_row` and `curr_row`) of size `(m + 1)`.\n",
    "  - After each iteration over `word1`, the `curr_row` becomes the `prev_row`, and the memory for the previous row is reused.\n",
